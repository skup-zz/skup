<a href="http://www.destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/">Dynamic tree</a>-widgets to replace the standard archives, categories, pages and link lists.

== Description ==

This plugin provides [dynamic navigation trees](http://www.destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/) to replace the standard archives, categories, pages and link lists. They're widgets so you can setup [the awesome tree navigation](http://game.hgo.se/cat/projects/3d-games/) with drag & drop ease, but it also exposes several [new template tags](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/other_notes/) for developers.

WP-dTree 4.0 is a complete re-write, bringing the plugin up to speed with the much matured WordPress 3 API. The overhaul has made WP-dTree significantly more sane and robust; it supports multiple widget instances, "foreign" characters, is more in tune with your themes, plays nice with translators and offers true fallbacks for those who surf without JavaScript.

*If you value [my plugins](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/ulfben/) and want to motivate further development - please **help me out** by [downloading and installing DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTIzMDI3MDk) from my refferal link. It's a cross-plattform application to sync your files online and across computers. A 2GB account is free and my refferal earns you a 250MB bonus!*

= Note: =
For some users the installation procedure left WP-dTree without a default configuration. If after installing and activating the widget all you get is [a wierd string of code](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-dtree-only-outputs-1-string-of-textcode), just go to Settings -> WP-dTree and hit "Update settings".

= Changes in v4.2 (2010-10-29) =
* Fixed the uninstallation procedure.

= Changes in v4.1 (2010-10-23) =
* Improved installation to fix [database error for some users](http://tinyurl.com/37352en)
* Added: ["limit posts" for categories and archives](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-dtree-limit-posts-under-categories?replies=2)
* Added: error catching - dtree can't blow up you other scripts
* Building archives is MUCH faster (2 queries total, from 1 per month)

= Changes in v4.0 (2010-10-17) =
* Completely recoded from the ground up for a much needed code overhaul.
*    **All previous settings will be lost!** Write them down before upgrading.
* Added: support for multiple tree instances
* Added: support for per-tree configurations 
* Added: [template tags](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/other_notes/) for theme developers
* Added: (optional) noscript for JS-disabled visitors
* Added: uses category descriptions for link titles
* Added: translation support
* Added: optional JS-escape (XHTML, HTML or none) to ease validation
* Added: caching is optional (per instance, to boot)
* Fixed: should properly encode quotes and HTML-entities
* Replaced Scriptacolous with jQuery
* Made truncation optional
* Removed support for WP <2.3
* Removed all CSS-options from admin area
* [Removed all non-essential CSS-rules](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/faq/)
* Only load jQuery if animation is on
* Minified JS and CSS (9KB vs. 16KB!)
* Cache is created on site visit (faster admin, less server load)

[Older changelogs moved here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/changelog/).

== Installation ==

1. If upgrading: *disable the old version first*!
1. Transfer the 'wp-dtree-30' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the 'WP-dTree' under 'Settings' to adjust your preferences
1. Go to 'Presentation' -> 'Widgets' and drag-n-drop the widgets to the relevant section of your sidebar(s)
1. Configure the active Widget to your liking
1. [Styling is done through CSS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/faq/)

[Developers and widget resistance goes here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/other_notes/).

== For developers ==

WP-dTree exposes the following [template tag functions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags):

* `wpdt_list_archives();`			
* `wpdt_list_categories();`
* `wpdt_list_pages();`
* `wpdt_list_links();`
* `wpdt_list_bookmarks(); //alias for wpdt_list_links`

They function a lot like WordPress own wp_list_* functions:

* They take an (optional) [query-string or associative array](http://codex.wordpress.org/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#Tags_with_query-string-style_parameters) with arguments
* They print by default, but if passed 'echo=0' they return the string of markup
* Most of them use the WordPress namesake for generating noscript-content

**Here's an example:**

`	<div class="dtree">`
`		<?php`
`			if(function_exists('wpdt_list_archives')){`					
`		   	    wpdt_list_archives('type=yearly&useicons=1');`
`			}`
`		?>`					
`	</div>`

I've tried to keep the same argument-lists as the WordPress "equivalents" but there are some discrepancies: style- and markup related arguments are not applicable to WP-dTree (but gets passed through for the noscript content).
There is also some inconsistency within WordPress, like some methods takes `sortby` while others takes `sort_column`. I've tried for WP-dTree to accept both but I'm sure I've missed a bunch of these cases.

So, to find out what arguments are definetly available grab the default `$args`:

* `wpdt_get_archives_defaults();` 
* `wpdt_get_categories_defaults();` 
* `wpdt_get_pages_defaults();`
* `wpdt_get_links_defaults();`

They all return associative arrays whith all arguments defaulted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WP-dTree looks horrible on my blog and I hate you for it! = 
WP-dTree 4.0 has almost no styles of its own - it inherits from your theme. To help you apply your own styling I've included a template CSS-file. Open `wp-dtree.css` and copy all the selectors into your theme's stylesheet. 
Now disable the plugins default CSS (from the Settings-panel) and hack away at your own file to make it pretty.

Remember - do not edit `wp-dtree.css`, as this will be replaced on every update of the plugin.

= Can I help you in any way? =
Absolutely! If you [sign up with DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTIzMDI3MDk) on my refferal, I get 1GB (much needed!) extra space. DropBox is a cross-plattform application to sync your files online and across computers, and a 2GB account is *free*. Also - my refferal earns you a 250MB bonus! 

If you've had any commercial applications for my plugins, please consider [sending me a book or two](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2QB6SQ5XX2U0N/105-3209188-5640446?reveal=unpurchased&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=standard&x). (used are fine!)

= Why is there no "Show more"-link for Archives? =
First: a simple workaround is to use 'Folders are links' and 'Show post count'. This way a visitor can easily see that a folder has more content than is on display, and clicking the folder name will bring her to it.

The reason there's no "Show more"-link for Archives is this: [limit posts in categories](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-dtree-limit-posts-under-categories?replies=2) was a *paid* request and I added that feature to archives too because it was reasonably simple and actually helped me optimize the code slightly. The "show more"-link was a simple addon for the Category generation code, but not so for Archives - it simply requires a lot of data to be available where it currently is **not**. So until someone feels strongly enough to pay me for the inconvenience, I won't bother bloating the code for this rather narrow feature.

= Can I change the images used by WP-dTree? =
The images are all stored in the 'wp-dtree/dtree-img/' directory. You can change them if you like. Just remember to keep the names the same or they won't appear.

== Other Notes ==

The original 'WP-dTree' was created by [Christopher Hwang](http://www.silpstream.com/blog/) in ~2005. By 2007 Mr. Hwang seemed to have dropped of the internet for good so [Ulf Benjaminsson](http://www.ulfben.com/) forked the plugin in and named it 'WP-dTree 3.0' (note to self: having a release number in the title is *stupid*).

Ulf's fork was focused on performance improvements - mainly caching - but soon expanded to add a lot of new features and modernizations; compatibility with WP 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, widgets, out-of-the-box Scriptaculous support, link trees, feed icons and more. 

For version 4.0 the entire plugin has been rewritten from scratch by Ulf, bringing it in line with the much matured WP 3.x API and generally being less of a hack. :P
